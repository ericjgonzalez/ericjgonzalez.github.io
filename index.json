You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python\rimport pandas as pd\rdata = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;)\rdata.head()\r```\r renders as\nimport pandas as pd\rdata = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;)\rdata.head()\r Math Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math.

The primary outcome was VE during randomized condition uroflow, defined as voided volume/(voided volume + residual volume). The secondary outcomes were pain during catheterization and to confirm previously reported pressure-flow changes. A sample size of 10 per group was planned to detect a clinically significant decrease in VE with a power (1-β) of 0.99. **Results:** From October to December 2018, 23 women were screened and 18 were randomized to receive placebo (n = 10) or lidocaine (n = 8). Baseline uroflow VE was similar between the placebo and lidocaine groups (88 ± 6.6% vs 91 ± 5.8%, P = .33). After study drug administration, the changes in VE (post-pre) were similar between placebo and lidocaine groups (-5.4 ± 14% vs 1.7 ± 6.4%, P = .21).

Inefficient voiding and urinary retention may arise in late-stage obesity when the expulsive force of the detrusor smooth muscle cannot overcome outlet resistance. Detrusor underactivity (DUA) and impaired contractility may contribute to the pathogenesis of nonobstructive urinary retention. We used cystometry and electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves (pudendal and pelvic nerves) to characterize and improve bladder function in urethane-anesthetized obese-prone (OP) and obese-resistant (OR) rats following diet-induced obesity (DIO). OP rats exhibited urinary retention and impaired detrusor contractility following DIO, reflected as increased volume threshold, decreased peak micturition pressure, and decreased voiding efficiency (VE) compared with OR rats. Electrical stimulation of the sensory branch of the pudendal nerve did not increase VE, whereas patterned bursting stimulation of the motor branch of the pudendal nerve increased VE twofold in OP rats. OP rats required increased amplitude of electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve to elicit bladder contractions, and maximum evoked bladder contraction amplitudes were decreased relative to OR rats. Collectively, these studies characterize a novel animal model of DUA that can be used to determine pathophysiology and suggest that neuromodulation is a potential management option for DUA.","tags":null,"title":"The effects of neuromodulation in a novel obese-prone rat model of detrusor underactivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS) is a major unresolved health concern with an economic burden approaching $500 million per year in lost productivity and health care costs.

There is, therefore, a critical need to understand mechanistically the neurochemical, functional, and organizational alterations underlying BPS and how this translates into the constellation of clinical symptoms.

We have previously demonstrated that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signalling contributes to increased voiding frequency and decreased bladder capacity with cystitis. Despite the functional presence of TGF-β in bladder inflammation, the precise mechanisms of TGF-β mediating bladder dysfunction are not yet known. Thus, the present studies investigated the sensory components of the urinary bladder that may underlie the pathophysiology of aberrant TGF-β activation. We utilized bladder-pelvic nerve preparations to characterize bladder afferent nerve discharge and the mechanisms of urothelial ATP release with distention. Our findings indicate that bladder afferent nerve discharge is sensitive to elevated extracellular ATP during pathological conditions of urinary bladder inflammation or irritation. We determined that TGF-β1 may increase bladder afferent nerve excitability by stimulating ATP release from the urothelium via vesicular exocytosis mechanisms with minimal contribution from pannexin-1 channels. Furthermore, blocking aberrant TGF-β signalling in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis with TβR-1 inhibition decreased afferent nerve hyperexcitability with a concomitant decrease in urothelial ATP release. Taken together, these results establish a role for purinergic signalling mechanisms in TGF-β-mediated bladder afferent nerve activation that may ultimately facilitate increased voiding frequency. The synergy between intrinsic urinary bladder signalling mechanisms and an inflammatory mediator provides novel insight into bladder dysfunction and supports new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

At the level of the lumbosacral spinal cord, lower urinary tract reflex mechanisms are modulated by supraspinal controls with mechanosensory input from the urothelium, resulting in regulation of bladder contractile activity. The specific identity of the mechanical sensor is not yet known, but considerable interest exists in the contribution of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels to the mechanosensory functions of the urothelium. The sensory, transduction, and signalling properties of the urothelium can influence adjacent urinary bladder tissues including the suburothelial nerve plexus, interstitial cells of Cajal, and detrusor smooth muscle cells. Diverse stimuli, including those that activate TRP channels expressed by the urothelium, can influence urothelial release of chemical mediators (such as ATP). Changes to the urothelium are associated with a number of bladder pathologies that underlie urinary bladder dysfunction. Urothelial receptor and/or ion channel expression and the release of signalling molecules (such as ATP and nitric oxide) can be altered with bladder disease, neural injury, target organ inflammation, or psychogenic stress. Urothelial receptors and channels represent novel targets for potential therapies that are intended to modulate micturition function or bladder sensation.","tags":null,"title":"Receptors, channels, and signalling in the urothelial sensory system in the bladder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric J.

CYP treatment increased ATP, Sub P, and CGRP expression in the urinary bladder and cystometric fluid. In CYP-treated rats, Tempol significantly (P ≤ 0.01) increased bladder capacity and reduced voiding frequency compared to CYP-treated rats without Tempol. Tempol significantly (P ≤ 0.01) reduced ATP expression, 3-NT, and ROS/RNS expression in the urinary tract of CYP-treated rats.

Currently, the etiology underlying altered visceral sensations from the urinary bladder that accompany the chronic pain syndrome, bladder pain syndrome (BPS)/interstitial cystitis (IC), is not known. Bladder irritation and inflammation are histopathological features that may underlie BPS/IC that can change the properties of lower urinary tract sensory pathways (e.g., peripheral and central sensitization, neurochemical plasticity) and contribute to exaggerated responses of peripheral bladder sensory pathways. Among the potential mediators of peripheral nociceptor sensitization and urinary bladder dysfunction are neuroactive compounds (e.g., purinergic and neuropeptide and receptor pathways), sensory transducers (e.g., transient receptor potential channels) and target-derived growth factors (e.g., nerve growth factor). We review studies related to the organization of the afferent limb of the micturition reflex and discuss neuroplasticity in an animal model of urinary bladder inflammation to increase the understanding of functional bladder disorders and to identify potential novel targets for development of therapeutic interventions. Given the heterogeneity of BPS/IC and the lack of consistent treatment benefits, it is unlikely that a single treatment directed at a single target in micturition reflex pathways will have a mass benefit. Thus, the identification of multiple targets is a prudent approach, and use of cocktail treatments directed at multiple targets should be considered.","tags":null,"title":"Bladder sensory physiology: neuroactive compounds and receptors, sensory transducers, and target-derived growth factors as targets to improve function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric J.

It was recently concluded that 3.3-7.9 million women (18 years old) in the United States exhibit BPS/IC symptoms. The impact of BPS/IC on quality of life is enormous and the economic burden is significant. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of BPS/IC are unknown, numerous theories including infection, inflammation, autoimmune disorder, toxic urinary agents, urothelial dysfunction, and neurogenic causes have been proposed. Altered visceral sensations from the urinary bladder (i.e., pain at low or moderate bladder filling) that accompany BPS/IC may be mediated by many factors including changes in the properties of peripheral bladder afferent pathways such that bladder afferent neurons respond in an exaggerated manner to normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia). The goals for this review are to describe chemokine/receptor (CXCL12/CXCR4; CCL2/CCR2) signaling and cytokine/receptor (transforming growth factor (TGF-β)/TGF-β type 1 receptor) signaling that may be valuable LUT targets for pharmacologic therapy to improve urinary bladder function and reduce somatic sensitivity associated with urinary bladder inflammation.","tags":null,"title":"The role(s) of cytokines/chemokines in urinary bladder inflammation and dysfunction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric J.

The present study investigated the functional profile of three pleiotropic transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) isoforms and receptor (TβR) variants in the normal and inflamed (CYP-induced cystitis) rat urinary bladder. Our findings indicate that TGF-β (1, 2, and 3) and TβR (1, 2, and 3) transcript and protein expression were regulated to varying degrees in the urothelium or detrusor smooth muscle following intermediate (48 h; 150 mg/kg ip) or chronic (75 mg/kg ip; once every 3 days for 10 days), but not acute (4 h; 150 mg/kg ip), CYP-induced cystitis. Conscious, open-outlet cystometry was performed to determine whether aberrant TGF-β signaling contributes to urinary bladder dysfunction following intermediate (48 h) CYP-induced cystitis. TβR-1 inhibition with SB505124 (5 μM) significantly (p ≤ 0.001) decreased voiding frequency and increased bladder capacity (2.5-fold), void volume (2.6-fold), and intercontraction intervals (2.5-fold) in CYP-treated (48 h) rats. Taken together, these results provide evidence for 1) the involvement of TGF-β in lower urinary tract neuroplasticity following urinary bladder inflammation, 2) a functional role of TGF-β signaling in the afferent limb of the micturition reflex, and 3) urinary bladder TβR-1 as a viable target to reduce voiding frequency with cystitis.","tags":null,"title":"Expression and function of transforming growth factor-beta isoforms and cognate receptors in the rat urinary bladder following cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis","type":"publication"}]
